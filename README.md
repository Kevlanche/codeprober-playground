# CodeProber playground

A playground for testing CodeProber (https://github.com/lu-cs-sde/codeprober/) without having to download anything to your machine.

Open the playground in Codespaces by:

1) Visit this repository on Github on a laptop or desktop (phone/tablet isn't supported).
2) Click the green "Code" button
3) Click the tab "Codespaces"
4) Click the "+" or big green "Create Codespaces [..]" button

It will load for a while. Once inside, CodeProber should start automatically. In the terminal, you can see a line containing "visit http://localhost:8000". Click the link while holding Ctrl(Windows/Linux) or Cmd(Mac). Alternatively, click the "Ports" tab next to the Terminal, locate the row for port 8000, click the little globe üåê that appears when you hover the row.

You are now inside CodeProber, playing with IntraJ (https://github.com/lu-cs-sde/IntraJ).

There are a number of sample exercies/questions in the example_exercises/ directory which can be solved in CodeProber.
Copy the source code from the txt files (everything above "-----------"), paste into CodeProber.
Then try to use CodeProber to answer the question (found immediately below the line in the txt file).
